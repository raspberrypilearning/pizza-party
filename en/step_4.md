## Add more equipment

Build on the cutter prototype with two more upgrades that make every click worth even more.

> [!TASK]
>
> Add a rolling pin as a new sprite.
>
> ![The demo project's rolling pin.](images/rolling_pin.png)
>
> Use your own equipment, or save [the rolling pin sprite](images/rolling-pin-sprite.png) and import it with **Upload**.

> [!TASK]
>
> Use the **Size** box below the Stage to resize the rolling pin, then drag it beside the cutter. The demo project's rolling pin is `30`% size.

> [!TASK]
>
> Open the rolling pin's **Costumes** tab. Right-click its costume and choose **duplicate**, keeping the plain costume first and the copied costume second.
>
> Add a green tick to the second costume so the player can see when the rolling pin has been bought.

> [!TASK]
>
> Copy the cutter's two scripts onto the rolling pin by dragging each script onto the rolling pin in the sprite list. Add the `Alert`{:class="block3sound"} and `Tada`{:class="block3sound"} sounds too.

Click until the score reaches 500. The rolling pin appears; click it to buy it and check that its green-tick costume appears.

> [!TASK]
>
> Add an oven as a new sprite.
>
> ![The demo project's oven.](images/oven.png)
>
> Use your own equipment, or save [the oven sprite](images/oven-sprite.png) and import it with **Upload**.

> [!TASK]
>
> Resize the oven and drag it beside the other equipment. The demo project's oven is `17`% size.

> [!TASK]
>
> Open the oven's **Costumes** tab. Right-click its costume and choose **duplicate**, keeping the plain costume first and the copied costume second.
>
> Add a green tick to the second costume so the player can see when the oven has been bought.

> [!TASK]
>
> Copy the rolling pin's two scripts onto the oven by dragging each script onto the oven in the sprite list. Add the `Alert`{:class="block3sound"} and `Tada`{:class="block3sound"} sounds too.

> [!TASK]
>
> Update the copied scripts for the oven. It costs `3000` and sets `pizzas per click`{:class="block3variables"} to `24`.
>
> <p align="center"><img src="images/oven.png" alt="Oven sprite icon." width="96" height="96" style="object-fit: contain;"></p>

Click until the score reaches 3000. Buy the oven and check that its green-tick costume appears and each click is worth 24. Later, helpers can also earn the final pizza needed to unlock equipment; the speech bubble makes it clear what the alert means.

> [!TASK]
>
> To win, make it so a player needs to get all the upgrades. On your main clicker sprite, update the `wait until`{:class="block3control"} so the player needs a high score **and** all the equipment (which sets `pizzas per click`{:class="block3variables"} to `24` in the demo project).

Buy all three pieces of equipment. The win message now only appears once the demo project is fully kitted out.
