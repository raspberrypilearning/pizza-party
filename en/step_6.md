## Add a second helper

Add a second, more powerful helper that makes five pizzas per second instead of one.

> [!TASK]
>
> Add another helper sprite. The demo project uses a granny.
>
> ![The demo project's granny helper.](images/granny.png)
>
> Use your own helper, or save [the granny sprite](images/granny-sprite.png) and import it with **Upload**.

> [!TASK]
>
> Use the **Size** box below the Stage to resize the second helper, then drag it into a clear position. The demo project's granny is `30`% size and sits below the chef on the right.

> [!TASK]
>
> Copy your first helper's two scripts onto the new sprite: drag each script from the code area and drop it onto the new sprite in the sprite list.

> Make a variable called `grannies`{:class="block3variables"} for how many of the second helper the player has hired.

> [!TASK]
>
> Make a variable called `granny price`{:class="block3variables"} for how many pizzas the next one costs.

> [!TASK]
>
> Add the `Collect`{:class="block3sound"} sound to the second helper sprite.

> [!TASK]
>
> Click the `Stage`{:class="block3looks"} and add starting values for the new variables. The second helper starts at `100` pizzas because it works five times faster.

Click the green flag. The new readouts should show `grannies 0` and `granny price 100`.

> [!TASK]
>
> On the second helper, update the copied buy script to use its sound, count, and price.
>
> The `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} stays at the end because buying either type of helper changes the pizzas-per-second rate.

> broadcast (update v)

> [!TASK]
>
> Update the copied green flag script so the second helper appears only when its own price is affordable.

Click the green flag and build the score. The first helper should appear at 50 pizzas and the second helper at 100 pizzas.

> [!TASK]
>
> On the `Stage`{:class="block3looks"}, update the `update pizzas per second`{:class="block3custom"} definition.
>
> The number of first helpers is already their contribution because each makes one pizza per second. Each granny makes five, so multiply only `grannies`{:class="block3variables"} by `5`.

> ```blocks3
> define update pizzas per second
> set [pizzas per second v] to ((helpers) + ((grannies) * (5)))

> Choosing costs and rewards so each upgrade feels worthwhile is called **game balancing**.

Buy one first helper and one granny. `pizzas per second` should become `6`: one from the first helper and five from the granny. Stop clicking and check that the score rises by six each second.

You now have a full endless clicker: clicks, equipment, and repeatable helpers all working together.

> Clicking, earning, buying upgrades, and then earning faster form the game's **core loop**.
